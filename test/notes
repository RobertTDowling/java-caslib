[ ] factoring integer scalars vs polynomials can't promote to factored
    first because we lose the context.

[ ] but if we DON'T promote, we can't make a factored be the output

[ ] perhaps factory needs to save the incoming types

[ ] I need this also for power function

[ ] since we instantiate a factory already, maybe having it hold some
    state isn't so bad. The the values that came in

[ ] do I need Binop factories and unop factories?

[x] Got All the rpncalcn functions implemented, and hand-tested

[x] Need test51 to succeed on converting PrimeFactored + Scalar = Scalar
 -- it was a mistake in Sclalar making FactoredPolynomial instead of PrimeFact

[x] Need restriction now, because 2x/x = 2, a polynomial, instead of 2 a Scalar

Sat Apr 25 10:48:37 PDT 2015

[/] Restriction by trying to simplify in the computation causes a
    problem in ver9 (backed up working into ver9a).  In order to
    return a restrict after say Polynomial division 2x/x, we need
    Polynomial.div to return Stackable, not Polynomial.  I've hacked
    this up in ver9, but it required making a set of _add, _sub, etc,
    that do return Polynomial, so that they can be used in the
    implementation of Polynomial division, which is written in terms
    of add, sub, etc.

Sat Apr 25 12:46:35 PDT 2015

    Perhaps a better approach would be to perform restriction outside
    the Polynomial class.

    [ ] Restriction in StackApp was good enough, except that it
        restricted anything that could be expressed as a scalar to a
        scalar....  Thus primefactors reverted back to scalars.  I
        need to test for Polynomials or FactoredPolynomials holding
        scalars.  When it was done in the Polynoimal class, I knew it
        was legit.  What new test do I add to Stackable for that?

        Currently, isScalar() returns true if whatever type it is, it
        could be expressed as a scalar.  What do we want to happen?

	Scalar(3) --> unchanged
	PF(3^1*2^2) --> unchanged or Scalar(12)?
	Poly(2x) -> unchanged because it can't be changed
	Poly(2) -> Scalar(2)
	FP((2x-1)*(x+2)) -> unchanged because it can't be changed
	FP(3)*(4)) -> Scalar(12) or PF(3^1*2^2)?

	Need to resolve the two ? cases above

	[ ] How do we decide when a PF should become a scalar?

	    R for when to restrict, x for leave alone:

	        +0 *1
	    S    x  x
	    PF   R  x
	    P    R  x
	    FP   R  x

	[!] I suppose the most flexible is to put a call in each of
	    the classes Stackable restrict() that does restriction if
	    it makes sense.

	[no] another thought is to restrict on input to operation

	    P(2) * PF(2*3) == S(2) * S(6) = S(12)3^1*2^2)

	    But operations like

	    P(x+1) - P(x) = S(1)

	    won't happen.  You need to evaluate output to decide if it is
	    simpler than the inputs

	l is simpler   -S PF  P FP
	than r      -S  n  n  y  y
		    PF  n  n  ?  y
		    -P  n  n  n  n
		    FP  n  n  n  n

	When an operation on Vector types (P, FP) results in a Scalar
	type (S, PF), we want to restrict output to Scalar.

	Likewise, if we go from a vector in 2 vars to a vector in 1
	var, we also want to consider this a restriction.

	[!] Only allow restriction when human asks for it?

Sat Apr 25 16:21:34 PDT 2015

[ ] For now, create a restriction function I can run by hand

So I propose a string format....

   3.2x^2-yz+7 -> P(VS(x,y,z),[3:T(S(3.2),EV(0x100)),T(S(-1),EV(0x11)),T(S(7),EV(0))])

[ ] / is not defined on factored types
    123 -> (41)(3) : 3 /  = (41)(3) still

[ ] Rendering is how rpncalcn handles things like primes and
factoring, because it can take time.  Now binop and unop can take
time.

   [ ] Perhaps the engine should be in its own thread, with a queue of
   computations and results

   [ ] Then binop would pop two values, and push a holder value,
   giving a handle to it to CalcEngine, which would fill it in when it
   was computed.  And rendered, I suppose.

   [ ] The whole model of rendering being how things are shown is
   backward compared to what cas does.  It makes object of different
   types, and each has its own toString()

Factory a multivariable polynomial using rational root theorem

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem

If the polynomial to be factored is a_nx^n + ... + a_0, then all
possible linear factors are of the form b_1x-b_0, where b_1 is an
integer factor of a_n and b_0 is an integer factor of a_0.

(x+y+6)^3 = x³+3x²y+3xy²+y³+18x²+36xy+18y²+108x+108y+216

Factor in x: (1)x³+(3y+18)x²+(3y²+36y+108)x+(y³+18y²+108y+216)

Factor 1x³ = +/- 1, 1x, 1x², 1x³
Factor (y³+18y²+108y+216) = (y+6)³ = +/- 1, (y+6), (y+6)², (y+6)³

What are the divisors of...  4x^3+8x^2+4x ?  18 of them

     1, 2, 4,                       x, 2x, 4x,
     x+1, 2x+2, 4x+4,               x^2+x, 2x^2+2, 4x^2+4,
     (x+1)^2, 2(x+1)^2, 4(x+1)^2,   x(x+1)^2, 2x(x+1)^2, 4x(x+1)^2

{1,2,4} x {1,x} x {1,x+1,(x+1)^2} == 2^{0,1,2} x x^{0,1} x (x+1)^{0,1,2}

What is _the factorizaion_ of 4x^3+8x^2+4x ?

     (4x)(x+1)^2

So Factorization returns a FactoredPolynomial type

     Sum { PolyCoef x Variable ^ Power }

Whereas divisors need to return 3 lists of (object, power) pairs

     PrimeFactored scalar GCD
     Evec of variable GCD
     FactoredPolynomial of P/GCD

All three could be expressed a Factored objects

Or it could be one massive Factored object: 

     2^2, x^1, (x+1)^2

Hmmm.  We could remove the gcd x^1 by looking at the power of the last
term in the polynomial.  That leaves the 2^2 and x+1^2.  One is
scalar, one is polynomial with coef 1.

Why is this so hard???

I'm getting wound up in trying to reuse code that can't be reused and
bad variable names and the fact that Emacs is not helping me with
refactoring and that I can't commit any of my work so it is a
minefield of commented out code I can't delete yet.

Look at more data

Could I end up with 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 -- yes and ver11 factors that 2x+3y

But 4x^2 + 12xy^2 + 9y^4 can't be factored by ver11 because it does
not do powers of the variable y

Let's look at my algorithm again, and see if I can simplify it

Poly: S*E+...+S*E, and E=v^a*...*z^e
PolyOfPolyInOneVar: POPIOV
PolyInOneVarOfPoly: Pn*v^n+...+Pk*v^k, k might==0  PIOVOP

Construct all S*v+T, where S|Pn and T|Pk

They can be constructed on the fly, or all at once.  That is an optimization.

FactoredPolynomial factorInZ () // Let p be an alias to 'this'
  Pick v, the first variable in p.
  Create empty list<poly> l to hold factoriztion of p (Which then
       becomes a FactoredPolynomial?  It could if we "mul" by factors,
       but let's skip that for now.)
  factorInZ (v, l)
  Construct array from arraylist <-- is this step necessary
  Construct FactoredPolynoimal from array
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polynomial [] factorInZ () // Let p be an alias to 'this'
  Make p1 be a PIOVOP(v) that is eqivalent to p (what is the container?)
  lead, last, are Polynomial
  let lead = leading coef polynomial of p1 <-- This is array index basically
  let last = last coef polynomial of p1
  let ldlead = list of divisor Polynomials of lead (not just factors)
  let ldlast = list of divisor Polynomials of last <-- These are Polynomial
  for (s: ldlead) {
     for (t: ldlast) {
        let d = sv+b        <-- d is Polynomial
        let q,r = p /mod d  <-- q,r are Polynomial
        if r.isZero
           add d to l
	   if degree (q) < 2
	     also add q to l
	   return
	recurse: q.factorInZ (v, l)
  Leftovers... add q to l

Commit it working for more cases in test35.ic except easiest x^2+2xy+y^2.

This is broken because we now express the last coef y^2 as
  1*y^2 + 0 y^1 + 0 y^0.

This appears to be solvable with GCD pulling y^2 and leaving 1 behind

Sat May  9 08:57:10 PDT 2015

x²+2xy+y² -> last=y² -> gcd y², rest=1
  we want -> +1, -1, +y, -y, +y^2, -y^2,

You know GCD has always exactly 1 term (or zero terms) so "lead" and
"last" terms are meaningless, or, we can't expect (av+b) to be a
factor of it ever.

We want divisors of 6y^2 to be (quite a few!)
   1, y, y^2, 2, 2y, 2y^2, 3, 3y, 3y^2, 6, 6y, 6y^2,
   -1, -y, ..., -6y^2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does Wolfram Alpha do with 6xy(x+1)^2 = 6x³y+12x²y+6xy?

6x(x+1)^2 y

Looks like it pulls out gcd 6xy, and factors the rest.

I keep going back and forth between findDivisors and factorInZ

I just figured out / remembered that

  void factorInZ (gcd, list) and
  Poly [] factorInZ ()
     each return n dups of each prime factor...
       18 -> 2,3,3
       x^2+2x+1 -> x+1, x+1

  list<Poly> findDivisors (Term gcd)
     returns for 18 -> [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 6, -6, 9, -9, 18, -18]
     returns for y²+2y+1 -> [1, -1, y+1, -y-1, y²+2y+1, -y²-2y-1]
     returns for y^2 -> [1, y^2] which is wrong, and why we can't factor x^2+2xy+y^2

and factorInZ calls findDivisors
But findDivisors calls factorInZ

Poly[] poly.factorInZ ()
   early out for 1
   pull out gcd
   Convert to array of polynomials in v
   Take the lead and last polynomials in that array
   dlead = lead.findDivisors()
   dlast last.findDivisors()
   Create all combinations of dlead * v + dlast and trial division
   Add to list if one divides, and recurse on lower degree   

list<Poly> poly.findDivisors ()
   if (isScalar()) {
       PrimeFactored jj (this); // calls Scalar.factorInZ 
   else (is Polynomial)
       Stackable [] r = poly.factorInZ ();
       FactoredPoly jj (r)
   set base,exp from each entry in Factored
   Add to list using lexographic walk of base[i]^exp[i]

NB: factorInZ will never factor v^2 because it does not try!

	Divisors of last[32] :
		    	  1 2 3 6  <--- 6
		   	  x 2x 3x 6x
			  x^2 2x^2 3x^2 6x^2
			  x^3 2x^3 3x^3 6x^3 and their negatives

So we need lots of divisors!

Synchronicity!

Obe site is up and patent is pending
 -and-
I also just fixed the problem that kept x²+2xy+y² from factoring

		if (p.isSingleTerm ()) {
			System.out.print (String.format ("P is single term: p=%s\n", p.toString()));
			// In fact, if we do GCD, we'll gcd=t, and p will then be 1.
			// Convert to n instances of each variable and prime factors of scalar
			Term t = p.getSingleTerm ();
			Scalar s = t.coef();
			Evec e = t.evec();

			// Prime factor the coef and put that in
			Scalar [] spf = s.factorInZ ();
			for (Scalar z: spf)
				l.add(new Polynomial(z));
			// Break apart the evec, and put that in
			Variable [] ef = e.factorInZ ();
			for (Variable z: ef)
				l.add(new Polynomial(z));
			return;
		}

		// Pull out gcd term
		Term g = p.gcdOfTerms();
		if (!g.isOne()) {
			p=p.div(new Polynomial(g));
			System.out.print (String.format ("Pulling out gcd=%s from p=%s leaving %s\n", g.toString(), this.toString(), p.toString()));
			// FIXEM this recurses forever and crashes
			// Stackable [] r = g.factorInZ ();
			// System.out.print (String.format ("gcd factors to [%s]\n", r.toString()));

			Scalar sg = g.coef();
			Evec eg = g.evec();
			// Prime factor the coef and put that in
			Scalar [] sgpf = sg.factorInZ ();
			for (Scalar z: sgpf)
				l.add(new Polynomial(z));
			// Break apart the evec, and put that in
			Variable [] egf = eg.factorInZ ();
			for (Variable z: egf)
				l.add(new Polynomial(z));
		} else {
			// Mark GCD as unimportant
			g = g;
		}

Inconsisten output:

6		(2)(3)
6x		(6x)
6xy		(2)(3)(x)(y)
6xy²		(2)(3)(x)(y)²
6x²y		(2)(3)(x)²(y)
6x-6y		(6x-6y)
6x²-6xy		(1)(x-y)(6)(x)
6xy-6y²		(1)(x-y)(6)(y)
6x-6		(6x-6)
6xy-6y		(1)(6)(y)(x-1)
-6x²+6xy+6x-6y	(-6x+6y)(x-1)

Where in the world are these 1's coming from?

xy-y²		(1)²(x-y)(y)
